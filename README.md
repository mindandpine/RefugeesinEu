# RefugeesinEu

      Data analysis project about Refugees in the EU

> This is a personal project that I started in order to practice my data skills.


**Step 1: Project Scope**

Elexploring the trends of refugee influx in the EU, analysing their demographics, main focus will be on unaccompanied minors & family reunification and Death rate.

**Step 2: Data Collection**

reliable sources of data related to refugees in the EU. Sources used: 
- Eurostat
- UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees),
- Dutch government database (CBS)
- IOM (international Organization for Migrantion) Missing Migrants project 


**Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preparation**

Currently I'm in the data cleaning and preparation process;  handling missing values, converting data types, dealing with outliers, and making sure the data is consistent. 

**Step 4: Create a Database**

With Docker I have setup the database.
Define tables to store different aspects of the data.

**Step 5: Import Data into the Database**

When the data is cleaned I while use phyton to import the data and use the pandas and numPy libraries. 

**Step 6: SQL Queries**

Explore the data and extract the necessary information:
- amount of refugees that are in the EU as percentage of the total (country) population.
- amount of percentage of refugees that are considered minors by EU-law < 21
- percentage of refugees that has been declared missing/ confirmed death
    -  also amount that was a minor.
- Gender differences

        
**Step 7: Data Analysis with Python**

Use Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, perform data analysis. Calculate summary statistics, create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots, heatmaps), and gain insights from the data.

**Step 8: Interpretation and Conclusion**

Interpret the results of your data analysis and draw conclusions. Discuss the key findings, patterns, and trends related to refugees in the EU based on your data analysis.

**Step 9: Data Visualization**

Create visually appealing and informative graphs, charts, and maps using Python visualization libraries. This will help convey your findings more effectively to your audience.

**Step 10: Documentation and Presentation**

Power BI or a opensource BI tool.
